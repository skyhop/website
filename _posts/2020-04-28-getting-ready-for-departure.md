<p class="text-lg font-thin">It's with great pleasure that I'm working on the finishing touches in order to be able to release Skyhop. It's with this blog post that I'm announcing Skyhop is almost ready to be released. In this post I'll look forward and discuss some of the features which will be available.</p>


Skyhop has been a pretty big project for me personally. The aims had been high, but the goal to build an automatic flight log has been achieved! Let me walk you through a few of the core features of Skyhop;

## The flight log

This is perhaps the most important part of Skyhop. Many digital logbooks have already been developed, but none helped you maintaining your flight information and only acted as a digital replacement for your paper logbook, thus resulting in the same workload you would have had with a paper one.

With Skyhop the feature I'm most excited about is automatic flight registration. Just look for the aircraft you have been flying with, choose your flight and it's been added to your logbook. That is literally all there is to maintaining a flight log.

## Flight analysis

Once a flight has been added to your logbook it becomes possible to view a detailed flight track. This track is projected onto a three dimensional map to ease intepretation of the flight path, and add a bit of relevant context when flying through rugged terrain.

When a sufficient amount of information is available, Skyhop will be able to calculate more contextual information about a flight. This includes information about the glide ratio, period and distance for certain parts where you were cruising or thermalling.

As icing on the cake there are 12 different parameters based on which you can plot and chart your flight performance. These parameters are:

- Altitude
- Bank angle
- Climbrate
- Horizontal acceleration
- Kinetic energy
- Lift
- Lift coefficient
- Load factor
- Speed
- Turn radius
- Turnrate
- Vertical acceleration

The relationships between these different parameters make it possible to get an incredibly detailed insight into your own flight performance. For more information about the background of these values, refer to [the documentation](/documentation/features/flight-analysis).


## What's next?

At the time of writing this I'm working on applying the finishing touches to get ready for launch. These efforts include tasks such as running the last few tests on Skyhop and activating social media channels. Just so you know, you can follow [Skyhop on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_skyhop), as well as [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Skyhop-103274767958275). For the technically minded people there is [GitHub](https://github.com/skyhop) where we host our open source projects. Give those a star as well!

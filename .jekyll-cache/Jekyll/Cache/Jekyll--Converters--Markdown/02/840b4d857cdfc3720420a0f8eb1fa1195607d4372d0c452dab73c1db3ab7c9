<h2 id="upcoming-features">Upcoming Features</h2>
<p>This is a list of upcoming features we are planning on implementing. Based on the interest there is in a certain feature we might increase itâ€™s priority or postpone it in favor of another feature. If you would be helped with a certain feature, please let us know!</p>

<h2 id="fully-automatic-flight-registration">Fully automatic flight registration</h2>
<p>While having a digital logbook is a nice feature, it does not solve the administrative task which comes with having a paper logbook. Our aim is to relieve you from this administrative burden, and automatically collect your flight information on your behalf.</p>

I"Á<p class="font-thin text-lg">When development on Skyhop began, I had a few problems in mind I was trying to solve. While not everyone within the aviation community actively struggles with these, I believe there are many who do. Let me explain those problems.</p>

<h2 id="1-information-is-manually-entered">1. Information is manually entered</h2>

<p>Absolutely the number one reason why I believe automatic flight logging is here to stay is the issues which come with manual flight logging. Though it kind of works most of the time, there are a lot of human factors involved. Some reasons why manual flight logging may go wrong:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The person logging the flights is distracted for a while, resulting in a best effort guess about the flight time.</li>
  <li>The focus and effort required to maintain flight logs does not mix well with other tasks, and therefore flight logging is one of the first tasks to be dropped once the workload increases. The lower the number of people maintaining flight operations, the lower the quality of the flight logs.</li>
  <li>Equipment failures. Sometimes batteries go flat, internet communication goes down, or there might be other reasons why it is impossible to maintain a proper flight log. Sometimes people fall back to scrabbling flight times on pieces of scrap paper.</li>
  <li>Manual (paper) flight entries have to be entered into a digital system, manually, and thus introducing small, but significant errors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those reasons combined result in a flight log which is far from accurate, resulting in maintenance crew complaining about the state of the administration down the line.</p>

<h2 id="2-hauling-with-sd-cards-to-access-flight-logs">2. Hauling with SD cards to access flight logs</h2>

<p>Personally my biggest frustration about collecting flight logs is having to carry around vulnerable micro SD cards. The airfield is a busy place, with lots of distractions, and grabbing data from a glider might very well disrupt flight operations on the airfield for a little while when the logger does not play nice.</p>

<p>Although processes can be implemented where one is responsible for collecting flight information from all aircraft, this is yet another action which requires habit, and might very well be forgotten.</p>

<p>Downstream this will limit the possible value of a flight debrief. Especially for students flying solo itâ€™s beneficial to have an instructor point out points of improvement. This practice is one which will definitely improve safety culture and transparency among the group.</p>

<p class="max-w-lg text-2xl my-10 font-bold text-center mx-auto text-gray-600">"For students flying solo it's beneficial to have an instructor point out points of improvement."</p>

<p>Although Iâ€™m heavily opposed against broad surveillance for the reason that it detoriates the safety culture, flight data can be used to spot risky behaviour before it becomes an actual issue. By default only the head of training, and the safety coordinator have access to all flights of a group. This way there is more transparency to ones flight performance, and special consideration can be taken when more training is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing to look for when analyzing flight performance is a sudden drop in lift nearby the turns from downwind to base, and from base to final. A sudden drop might indicate things such as turbulence, insufficient airspeed, or lack of attention. <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/easa-and-you/general-aviation/flying-safely/loss-of-control-in-approach-and-landing">Loss of control during approach and landing phases</a> is the second most risky phase of the flight. <a href="/documentation/features/flight-analysis#estimations">See the documentation about flight analysis.</a></p>

<h2 id="3-having-to-recover-broken-weak-links">3. Having to recover broken weak links</h2>

<p>Whether you are flying from a military base, or recover your weak links for environmental reasons, recovering those can take a lot of time. Especially when searching for it with 20 people at a time. Luckily weak links also follow the laws of physics, and therefore their paths can be modelled. Skyhop has functionality built in to estimate a path to walk in order to find the weak link, depending on when it was disconnected.</p>

<h2 id="4-save-yourself-some-money">4. Save yourself some money</h2>

<p>Although money saving measures are always a smart investment, they are particularly so in times of financial uncertainty.</p>

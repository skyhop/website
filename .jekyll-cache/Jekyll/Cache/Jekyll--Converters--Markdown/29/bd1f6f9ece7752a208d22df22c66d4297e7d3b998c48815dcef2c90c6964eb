I"M<p class="font-thin text-lg">Started back in 2016, I wanted to build a tool which I could use for in depth flight analysis, without having to haul around with micro SD cards in order to collect flight tracks for the day from multiple aircraft. Since then I have been working on the technology to make this vision reality, and have changed the core principle of the product several times. This has resulted in a product which I truly love myself, and I think many people alike.</p>

<p>I started flying gliders back in 2015. Having dreamt a lot about flying it was literally a dream come true. With me my little brother started flying, too, and as such there was some competition between us who could make the longest flight, catch the strongest thermal and so on, ahwell, you get it. We were hauling around with micro SD cards in order to collect IGC files from the flight loggers, so we could compare each others performance afterwards. This is one of the first reasons I started building Skyhop. I was tired of all those small manual tasks all the time.</p>

<p>The second reason came a bit later, as soon as it came apparent that I had technical skills, and I was moved forward to maintain the existing administrative systems. Compared with the situation other gliding clubs were in, the administrative systems at our gliding club were great, but maintenance heavy, difficult to navigate, and most importantly, required manual interactions in order to log flights. The resulting frustration was big. The board was annoyed that reports were not correctly working, and if they were would contain incorrect information, and maintenance crew had loudly been complaining about incorrect information resulting in a disrupted maintenance schedule.</p>

<h2 id="the-product">The product</h2>

<p>My aim over the course of those years has been to consolidate those wishes into a product which would fit all of them. At first I had purely been focussed on flight analysis, which would satisfy the first one of my personal goals. Though this worked on itself, it posed usability problems when requiring consistent flight registration. For this to work correctly I needed to shift the focus of the product from being a flight analysis tool to being a digital logbook. Although the analysis features still existed, their placement had changed to become a part of the logbook.</p>

<p>The interaction between those two is where I have put the focus on with Skyhop. Creating an easy to use logbook would not have been possible without flight analysis. Although flight analysis is possible without a logbook, it is much easier to access your flights when they are organized the way a logbook is.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-personal-journey">About my personal journey</h2>

<p>Having been a software developer for roughly 8 years now I have seen my fair share of bad practices, and have directed a tremendous part of my effort towards ensuring the quality and stability of Skyhop. This habit enables me to ensure the long term viability of Skyhop which includes ongoing support, and the ongoing development of new features for the forseeable future.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-it-take-so-long-to-create-this">Why did it take so long to create this?</h3>

<p>One thing I’m being asked about quite often is why it has taken such a long time to release this software. Although I certainly could have shipped something faster, I could not have shipped more quickly with the level of quality I aim to deliver. Skyhop in it’s current shape is something I’m truly satisfied with myself, and offers the best which I’m technically able to offer. In the period I have been working on Skyhop I have learned a tremendous amount about many topics related to both aviation and software development, which have all contributed to this product.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-peek-into-the-future">A quick peek into the future</h2>

<p>What’s available right now is only a first version. I have many ideas for improvement, and additional features which would be beneficial to glider pilots, and general aviation as a whole. In fact, I have so many that I would be busy for the upcoming five years if I had to implement them all. Some features I’m thinking about implementing are competition modes, special search and rescue tooling, airspace analysis, and some other features specially built for flight schools like the implementation of a student administration system, and features to track maintenance processes.</p>

<p>To be able to build this I need your support! Purchasing a subscription will not only get you everything currently available, but is also an investment in the future development of this software.</p>

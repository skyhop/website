I"Î<p class="font-thin text-lg">At Skyhop we have been working with the goal to create a technical framework which will keep everything running smoothly for the upcoming decennia, while giving us the power to innovate at breathtaking speeds. In order to encourage ourselves to deliver quality, both when it comes to the value delivered, as well as technical excellence, we offer access to our API's to everyone interested in making applications using Skyhop as data source.</p>

<p>Our back-end is composed of a GraphQL API which we use ourselves to run the web application. This API is available at <a href="https://api.skyhop.org/graph">api.skyhop.org/graph</a>. This GraphQL API is authorized through our OAuth service which you can find over at <a href="https://login.skyhop.org">login.skyhop.org</a>.</p>

<p>If something is not clear, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us via <a href="mailto:support@skyhop.org">support@skyhop.org</a>, and weâ€™ll see how we can help you!</p>

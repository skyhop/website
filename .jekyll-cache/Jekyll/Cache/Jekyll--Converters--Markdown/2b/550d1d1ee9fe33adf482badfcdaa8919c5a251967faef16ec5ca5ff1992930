I"ü<p class="font-thin text-lg">Skyhop is built with the goal to simplify the maintenance of your logbook. We have built features which can help you with this, whether you want to maintain a flight log for your airfield, aircraft, or for yourself. Around this idea of a digital logbook we have built tooling which uses the information from the logbook to help with everyday tasks such providing detailed flight logs for debriefing purposes or bragging rights.</p>

<p>Skyhop has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/features/the-digital-logbook.html">A digital logbook</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/features/flight-analysis.html">Flight analysis features</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/features/weak-link-recovery.html">Weak link recovery</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Given Skyhop is a continuous work in progress, we are open for feedback and suggestions. Our <a href="/documentation/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> describes some things we will be working on in the nearby future. If there are things which you would love to see implemented, but are not yet on the roadmap, feel free to contact us and we will see how we can best address your need.

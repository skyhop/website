I"á<p class="font-thin text-lg">Started back in 2016, I wanted to build a tool which I could use for in depth flight analysis, without having to haul around with micro SD cards in order to collect flight tracks for the day from multiple aircraft. Since then I have been working on the technology to make this vision reality, and have changed the core principle of the product several times. This has resulted in a product which I truly love myself, and I think many people alike.</p>

Central to all other features within Skyhop is the digital logbook, which you can use as a replacement of your traditional logbook. Skyhop is there to help you make maintaining your flight records easier.

Skyhop manages to do so by automatically collecting all relevant flight information in a way that you only have to select the specific flight, thus removing the burden of having to keep track of your flight times.

## Upcoming improvements

In order to simplify the process of logbook maintenance even more we're working on a mechanism to automatically add your flights to your logbook. We'll elaborate more about this feature in future updates.

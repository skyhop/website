Thank you for checking out the documentation for the `SkyHop.FlightAnalysis` project! This library is a powerful tool to process a flight track into information you can directly enter into your (EASA) flight log. The idea behind this library is that it should be possible to extract basic flight information based on automatic position reports broadcasted by systems like ADSB or Flarm. Another possibility would be to extract the flight log from the avionics systems and analyse these later using a specific tool.

## Features

The following features are currently available in the library:

* Post flight processing
* Real-time flight processing (based on live feeds)
* Tooling to help process information from either a single aircraft or a bunch of aircraft

Features which are planned to be implemented in the near future:

* Glider launch method detection (Winch, aerotow or motor)
* Real-time detection of circuit movements

## Platform Support

The compiled libraries are targeting .NET Standard 2. Therefore you can use these starting from .NET Framework 4.6.1.

## Installation

The library can be added to your project in a number of ways:

### NuGet

The `Boerman.FlightAnalysis` library is available through NuGet and can be installed as follows:

    Install-Package Boerman.FlightAnalysis

### .NET CLI

To install the library through the .NET CLI you can use the following command:

    dotnet add package Boerman.FlightAnalysis

### Building From Source

You can always grab the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/skyhop-org/FlightAnalysis) and build the code yourself!

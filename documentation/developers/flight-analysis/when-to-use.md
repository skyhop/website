The goal of this library is to provide metadata about flights being made in near real time. This library is capable of providing the following information based on position information from a single aircraft:

* Departure location
* Departure heading
* Departure time
* Arrival location
* Arrival heading
* Arrival time
* Total flight time
* Route of the flight

By combining location and heading information it is extremely straightforward to determine the airfield being used and even the runway which has been used. Providing information about runway use for an airfield with 6 runways is no problem at all for this library!

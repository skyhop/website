# Get Started

Thanks for your interest in Skyhop! We would love to have you onboard.

Not sure if this is the right product for you? Please consider the following aspects:

## Automatic flight registration
The most convenient feature of Skyhop relies on some external data sources. In order to be able to automatically determine flight information we rely on data collected from OGN. If your airfield does not have FLARM coverage, you can install a local FLARM station in order to improve coverage.

If your aircraft is not equipped with FLARM, but you still want to use automatic flight logging, please send an email to [support@skyhop.org](mailto:support@skyhop.org), and we'll look into possibilities to help you further!

Just so you know, Skyhop works perfectly fine without automatic flight registration, but it would take you some more in order to keep it up-to-date.

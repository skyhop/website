<p class="font-thin text-lg">Today we're pre-announcing the virtual briefing room. This new product will exist outside of Skyhop, and set the new standard for debriefing sessions. Using Augmented Reality (AR) technology we're bringing your flight to life, and make it possible to get a detailed overview of your flight like never before.</p>

This new product will be offered as accessory to a Skyhop subscription, specially targeted towards flight schools. Using the latest developments in the Augmented Reality world we're able to visualise your flight performance unlike ever before. Using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 it is possible to visualise your flight path, including terrain and other trafic right in your briefing room. It's just like we've built a maquette specifically to memorate your flight.

## Pricing
It is our expectation that we will be able to offer the virtual briefing room for a total of around €4000,- per device. Alternatively we are exploring the possibility of offering a lease on HoloLens devices, which we expect to be priced at roughly €175/month.

<p class="font-thin text-lg">Yesterday I have shipped an update to Skyhop introducing support for FANET (Flying Ad-Hoc Network). Even though is quite similiar to FLARM, which is already supported, there are a few subtle mechanics which we needed to tackle in order to make it work.</p>

Specifically this means we have paved the way to support devices often used by paragliders such as the Skytaxx.

Yesterday I have shipped an update to Skyhop introducing support for FANET (Flying Ad-Hoc Network). Even though is quite similiar to FLARM, which is already supported, there are a few subtle mechanics which we needed to tackle in order to make it work.

Specifically this means we have paved the way to support devices often used by paragliders such as the Skytaxx.

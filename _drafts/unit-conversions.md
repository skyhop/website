title: "Unit conversions"

In an effort to make sure everyone clearly understands the units we're communicating in, we have built a new feature with which every unit can be converted into any other relevant unit. Whether you want to reflect the distance you've flown in picometers or astronomical units or light years, we've got you covered.


## Closing the gap

Although the practical application of those units is quite difficult in aviation, different regions and types of aviation use different units. The goal of this feature is to close that gap, and offer a bit of personalisation to your preferences. Whether you like to reflect your speed in meters per second, knots or kilometers per hour, it's all possible.

Not only can we seamlessly convert between distance or speed units, but we can also convert almost any other unit into an arbitrary relevant unit. The following types of data can be converted into an unit you prefer:

- Speed
- Distance
- Acceleration
- Force
- Duration
- Pressure

It is possible to set default values for each type of unit on your profile. In the upcoming period we'll explore opportunities where it is beneficial to be able to switch between different units right away. One of those will be in the chart builder.

## The benefit for developers

Because we have implemented the conversion logic on the back-end, people creating custom integrations with Skyhop can benefit from the ease of access, and do not have to pick their brains to write a correct conversion.

I'm grateful the demo I've released last week has been received pretty well. Development has still been ongoing though, and I'm happy to announce some new features.


## The archive

In order to facilitate a wider range of usage scenarios I have built a feature which I call the archive. The archive is meant as a place where metadata can be found about all flights which are collected. Although it is possible to add a flight to your own personal logbook from here, it is primarilly meant to facilitate in specific reporting requirements.

title: "Saving time by automation"

<p class="font-thin text-lg">It's in the nature of humans to take common things for granted. As soon as we've been surprised by something new, we adapt our future expectations to fit in with this surprise. It's why we, despite automation becoming widespread, are still expected to work 40 hours in a week, as well as why people are numbed down over time by the (in)actions of fascist leaders.</p>

My aim is to make this post a little bit less controversial than previous two statements, as I want to write about the time saving capabilities Skyhop currently has. I'll cover certain use-cases wherein I believe Skyhop shines, and outperforms alternatives.

I'm pretty sure that I personally will never recoup the time I have spent building this product. An optimistic estimate about the time spent developing Skyhop would lead to over 3000 hours. This amount of time would probably account for a lifetime of personal administrative tasks. However, let's check out how much time it could save you;


## Maintaining your logbook

I have just ran a trial, trying to simulate my performance when using a traditional logbook, compared against using Skyhop. It took me roughly 45 seconds penning the information into my logbook, while it took only 10 seconds entering it with Skyhop, essentially shaving 35 seconds off the process.

Assuming you'd make 5 flights a day, it'll save you almost three minutes.

At 100 flights a year it will save you one hour of work!


## Logging departures and arrivals

One of the tasks we always have new members of our gliding club do is keeping track of departures and arrivals, under the pretense that they'll get to know the names of fellow members.

Let's create time saving estimates for both situations, on a dull day without too much thermals.


| # Flights | Actual busy time |
|-----------|------------------|
|     1     |    30 sec        |
|     2     |    1 min         |
|     5     |    2.5 min       |
|     10    |    5 minutes     |
|     25    |    12.5 minutes  |
|     50    |    25 minutes    |
|    100    |    50 minutes    |
|    200    |    100 minutes   |


Because the person keeping track of times has to keep an eye out for aircraft movements around the launchpad there isn't the possibility to do something else, which will result in much more time spent than shown in the table above. In reality the time spent keeping track of flights is as long as the time period of ongoing flight activity.

Put another way, a person keeping track of time, is one person less to keep flight activities going. I've seen start leaders, launch managers or however you call them at your gliding club, try to combine the management of operations with keeping track of time. Although this might work with a small number of aircraft, everything seems to fall apart once the workload becomes too high (think about wanting to launch an aircraft just before another one is landing).

As a matter of fact I believe Skyhop could save you some hands on the airfield.


## Keeping track of aircraft logs

Another common occurence after a day of flying is to update the aircrafts journal. Although I estimate someone enters this information incorrectly 5% of the time, thus requiring 20 minutes of cleanup later on, I will not take this time into consideration now.

This task is also highly dependent on the way flight logs are ordered, and how easy it is to extrapolate the total number of flights and total flight time for a day. However, given the journal is one of the documents which is mandatory to have on board, we cannot rely on a digital system to keep track of an aircrafts flights, although we can run a digital shadow copy. Because of this we'll estimate this process will take about 2 minutes for each aircraft, but will not be counting this amount of time in our totals.


## The big picture

I have spent an tremendous amount of time myself building Skyhop. Although I will not possibly ever save myself time by using Skyhop, I believe I have potentially freed up a mindboggling amount of time. Let me demonstrate by a back of the envelope calculation;

In the Netherlands there are about 100.000 glider flights each year. Adding up the time spent to maintain your own logbook, and to keep track of the departures and arrivals will result in a total time sink a little over 2000 hours. 

In the Netherlands there are 34 soaring clubs averaging about 3000 flights each. Effectively Skyhop can save, on average, about

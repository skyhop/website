Last year I comitted to launching Skyhop in March 2020. I have already postponed launch due to a burnout before, and now there's a pandemic spoiling the fun. Apparently there is never a perfect time to launch. To make the best out of this situations I have been making a few changes and made premium features available for free. Read further for more details;


During this time where an pandemic is ravaging through the world, the inability to fly is only a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. With the social distancing measures in place in the Netherlands flight training is out of the picture for a while.

As stated by the NOTAM:

```
COVID-19: FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES COVID-19 BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES BASED ON DIRECTIVES MINISTRIES OF HEALTH AND JUSTICE,
GENERAL AVIATION FLIGHTS INCLUDING AERIAL WORK WITH POB, OTHER THAN
HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS, DISTANCE LESS THAN 1,5M ARE PROHIBITED.
POLICE, HEMS AND SAR FLIGHTS ARE EXEMPTED.
FROM: 24 APR 2020 13:25 TO: 20 MAY 2020 12:00 EST
```


## The offer

After all this time working on Skyhop I don't feel like waiting much longer for a change to release this project. However, many are not flying at this time, and I feel it is unreasonable to expect people to pay for something they cannot use, or enter a trial period for something they cannot properly try out.

As such, instead of offering a time limited trial, I'll offer the premium features on Skyhop for free until you get to fly again. This way you give Skyhop a try, and explore some of your past flights before comitting to a purchase, once you get to fly again.

  <span class="text-xl font-medium flex max-w-sm text-center">Use the premium subscription for free until you get to fly again!</span>

I'd be thrilled for you to try Skyhop with some of your latest flights and see how well it works for you!
